## Old projects
### Building between 2008 and 2011



All projects posted here were built when I was 13 to 16 at the programming school to learn more in Jales!


Unfortunately, between 2011 and 2014, I did few activities on a computer because I was focused on entering ITA but I could not, but I'm happy to be at UFSC, where I did great things with wonderful people! (I have no idea if this repository will be just for codes or a series on my blog: matheusfrancisco.github.io)

Going back to programming in 2014 thanks to the Computer Engineering course I will post future projects of courses that I am doing or even projects of my head !!
